# Joustle

Joustle is an asynchronous multiplayer PvP game inspired by Super Auto Pets, Scrabble, and Wordle. In Joustle, players construct words that go head-to-head in battle. Each letter has its own strengths based on its rarity, and forming coherent words enhances combat power through multipliers dependent on word length and uniqueness. Victory depends on your linguistic skill and strategic decision-making as you buy letters from the shop, make use of the freezer, and budget your money accordingly to construct powerful words.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Multiplayer PvP:** Battle players from around the world in word-based combat, where timing isnâ€™t crucial, and you can take turns at your own pace.

- **Letter Rarity System:** Less common letters (e.g., Q, X, Z) have stronger attack power, giving you an incentive to craft unique and difficult words.

- **Word-Based Multipliers:** Forming complete words grants powerful multipliers, allowing clever players to dominate battles.

- **Dynamic Shop:** Purchase letters from a random shop, strategize which letters to buy, and form the best possible word combinations to fight with.

- **Drag and Drop:** Beautiful, intuitive drag-and-drop mechanics powered by React, making word-building easy and enjoyable.

- **Responsive UI:** Fully responsive design using Bootstrap, ensuring that the game looks great and functions smoothly on any device.

- **Data Persistence:** All game data is stored in JSON format, ensuring quick access and scalability.
